DESIGN PATTERNS toolkit of tried ans tested solutions to common problems in software design



CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS provide us different objet creation mechanisms

STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERNS help us to asseble into flexible and efficient code structures

//utliser dans ce cours
BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERNS deal with communication and assigning responsibilities between objects

STATE DESIGN PATTERNS is a behavioural pattern that lets an object alter it's behaviour when it's internal state changes

avoid if/else complicate statement if we decide to add more move or feature etc... (spaghetti code)
more easy to maintain the code

code structure fintite State Machine, limite set of state (standing, jumping, sitting...) react only on a limite set of INPUT we define.
we have a CLASS for each STATE

use native JAVASCRIPT MODULES to split our code into multiple parts (part of ES6 standard) MEMBERS of MODULES (= class, function, variables) can be exported and imported around our program, wherever they are needed


Types of exports:
    1) Named exports     need of {x, y, z, ....}       can have multiple  
    2) Default export    need keyword default          only one 

4 Principles of Object Oriented Programming:
    1) ENCAPSULATION (ex: class PLAYER in player.js)
            -we wrap variables or data and functions that operate on that data into objects
            -can be use to protect our data from unwanted outside access, it simplifies maintenance of our code by keeping it organised and easier to understand

    2) INHERITANCE
            -is a process where one class inherits attributes and methods from another class.
            -we use it to avoid code repetition
            -exemple: (in state.js) class State is the PARENT CLASS also call 'super' class
                      class StandingRight CHILD CLASS also call 'sub' class   extends keywords
            -use SUPER keyword in child classes to access and call methods on object's parent
    3) POLYMORPHISM
            -allows methods to display different behaviour depending on which class calls it
            -exemple: (in state.js) enter() and handleInput() in CHILD CLASS standingLeft and StandingRight
